### Raycast Scripts

This repo is a combination of the [Raycast Community Repo](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands) and my own [Automation Scripts](https://github.com/jackparsonss/Automation-Scripts)

All the scripts here are ones I use to automate my workflow and improve productivity

This is meant to be storage so that when I switch devices or the folder accidently gets deleted, I will be up and running quickly
